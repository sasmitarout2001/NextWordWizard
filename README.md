# ðŸ“šâœ¨ NextWordWizard: LSTM & GRU Next Word Prediction Model
Predict the next word like magic â€” with LSTM/GRU RNNs!
Welcome to **NextWordWizard**, an NLP project that trains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using LSTM or GRU layers to **predict the next word** given an input text sequence.

---

## ðŸš€ What does this project do?

- Takes a text dataset (like song lyrics, speeches, or books).
- Tokenizes the text into sequences.
- Generates `n-gram` training sequences.
- Builds an Embedding + LSTM/GRU RNN model.
- Trains the model to learn the sequence patterns.
- Predicts the most probable **next word** for any given input text.
